# Connect4game
Connect 4 is a classic two-player strategy game where the objective is to align four of your pieces in a row on a grid before your opponent does. It is often played on a vertical 6-row by 7-column grid, with players alternately dropping colored discs (usually red and yellow) into the columns. The discs stack from the bottom up, and the first player to connect four pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
